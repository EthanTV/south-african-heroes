<nav>Comments about Nelson Mandela</nav> *make bold*
<p> Alexk11 </p>
<p> "It's amazing how he held none of the rancor and bitterness that might have accompanied someone wrongly incarcerated for so long. He rose above all that to emphasis reconciliation. Nelson Mandela is a benchmark for humanity. RIP" </p>

<p> Joe Bialek </p>
<p>"This man will be sorely missed. Human beings like Mandela are hard to find. He was a truly wise statesman in every aspect, a freedom fighter against the Apartheid oppression. Good bye, Madiba. Your beloved nation weeps, so does the rest of the world."  </p>

<p> Tom Meadowcroft </p>
<p> "Nelson Mandela was a credit to his race - the human race." </p>

<h3>Entering politics</h3>
<p>Mandela, while increasingly politically involved from 1942, only joined the African National Congress in 1944 when he helped to form the ANC Youth League (ANCYL).

        In 1944 he married Walter Sisulu’s cousin, Evelyn Mase, a nurse. They had two sons, Madiba Thembekile "Thembi" and Makgatho, and two daughters both called Makaziwe, the first of whom died in infancy. He and his wife divorced in 1958.
        
        Mandela rose through the ranks of the ANCYL and through its efforts, the ANC adopted a more radical mass-based policy, the Programme of Action, in 1949.</p>

  <p>In 1952 he was chosen as the National Volunteer-in-Chief of the Defiance Campaign with Maulvi Cachalia as his deputy. This campaign of civil disobedience against six unjust laws was a joint programme between the ANC and the South African Indian Congress. He and 19 others were charged under the Suppression of Communism Act for their part in the campaign and sentenced to nine months of hard labour, suspended for two years.</p>
      
  

<p>A two-year diploma in law on top of his BA allowed Mandela to practise law, and in August 1952 he and Oliver Tambo established South Africa’s first black law firm, Mandela & Tambo.</p>
        
<p>At the end of 1952 he was banned for the first time. As a restricted person he was only permitted to watch in secret as the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown on 26 June 1955.</p>
